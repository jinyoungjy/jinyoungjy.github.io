    title: Background information
    summary: |
        Hello, my name is Jinyoung Kim. I'm an undergraduate student at POSTECH, 
        majoring in Electrical Engineering with a strong interest in and real-world 
        problem solving through technology.
        
        I lived in Thailand from 2008 to 2019, where I developed a global perspective and bilingual communication skills.
        This international upbringing has helped me approach problems from multiple cultural and analytical angles.
        
        Since returning to South Korea, I have continued to pursue challenging academic projects and collaborative initiatives, both in and out of the classroom. My experiences span embedded systems, 
        software development, and wireless communication engineering. I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software, and 
        I'm passionate about building efficient, scalable, and impactful solutions — whether in research labs, or engineering teams.
